# 📈 Ongoing Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts real-time stock prices using historical data and deep learning.

## 📌 Objective

- Fetch live or recent stock prices
- Visualize past trends and patterns
- Predict future prices using LSTM (or similar time-series models)
- (Coming soon) Deploy a minimal web interface for interaction

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- yfinance (for live data)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- LSTM / GRU (Keras or PyTorch)
- (Optional) Streamlit / Flask for frontend

## 🚀 Status

`Code Coming Soon 🚧`
